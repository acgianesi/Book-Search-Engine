# Book Search Engine 

## Description

The Book Search Engine is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can sign up, log in, save their favorite books, and remove books they no longer wish to keep. This application has been refactored to use Apollo Server for GraphQL APIs.
